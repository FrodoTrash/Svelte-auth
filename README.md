# Svelte x Pocketbase Basic Auth Template

## Developing

I used `pnpm` so install `pnpm i` and then `pnpm dev`

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
